# opencli Reader (Generic Fallback, Read-Only)

Generic fallback for any source opencli supports via its [adapter registry](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli) (90+ sites, growing). Use this skill only when **no dedicated finance-skill covers the source** — the specialized skills (`twitter-reader`, `linkedin-reader`, `discord-reader`, `telegram-reader`, `yc-reader`) are always preferred when the request matches one of them.

**This skill is read-only.** Write commands that opencli exposes (post, like, comment, send, save, upvote, subscribe, follow, delete, reply-dm, etc.) must not be invoked.

---

## Step 1: Decide Whether to Use This Skill

Only use this skill if the request **cannot** be handled by a more specific skill.

| If the user asks about… | Use this skill instead |
|---|---|
| Twitter/X | `twitter-reader` |
| LinkedIn | `linkedin-reader` |
| Discord | `discord-reader` |
| Telegram | `telegram-reader` |
| Y Combinator | `yc-reader` |
| Anything else opencli supports (Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, Reuters, Reddit, HackerNews, Eastmoney, Xueqiu, Substack, arXiv, etc.) | **this skill** |

If the source is not in opencli's registry either, stop and tell the user the request isn't covered — don't fall back to ad-hoc scraping.

---

## Step 2: Ensure opencli Is Ready

**Current environment status:**

```
!`(command -v opencli && opencli doctor 2>&1 | head -5 && echo "READY" || echo "SETUP_NEEDED") 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_INSTALLED"`
```

If `NOT_INSTALLED`:

```bash
npm install -g @jackwener/opencli
```

If `SETUP_NEEDED`, guide the user through Browser Bridge setup (only required for adapters whose strategy is `COOKIE`, `HEADER`, `INTERCEPT`, or `UI` — `PUBLIC` and `LOCAL` adapters work without a browser):

1. Download the latest `opencli-extension-v{version}.zip` from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/releases)
2. Unzip it, open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome, enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped folder
4. Make sure Chrome is logged into the target site, then re-run `opencli doctor`

Requires Node.js >= 21 (or Bun >= 1.0).

---

## Step 3: Discover the Right Command

**Do not guess command names or flags** — the registry has 500+ commands and changes weekly. Instead:

```bash
# Full registry (grouped by site), machine-readable JSON
opencli list -f json

# Filter to a site
opencli list | grep -i <site>

# Site-level help (all commands + flags)
opencli <site> --help

# Command-level help (positional args + flags + defaults)
opencli <site> <command> --help
```

The `opencli list -f json` entry for each command includes:
- `site` — adapter namespace (e.g., `yahoo-finance`)
- `name` — subcommand (e.g., `quote`)
- `strategy` — `PUBLIC` / `COOKIE` / `HEADER` / `INTERCEPT` / `UI` / `LOCAL` — tells you if a browser login is needed
- `description`, `args`, `columns` — canonical metadata

Use `opencli list -f json` as the source of truth. Never paste a site list into the plan from memory; adapters are added every week.

---

## Step 4: Check the Adapter's Strategy Before Running

Run `opencli list -f json` (or `opencli <site> <command> --help`) and read the `strategy` field:

| Strategy | What it means | Preconditions |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLIC` | Pure HTTP; no browser needed | None |
| `LOCAL` | Talks to a local endpoint | Local service running |
| `COOKIE` / `HEADER` | Reuses your Chrome login for the site | Chrome logged into the site + Browser Bridge extension loaded |
| `INTERCEPT` | Opens an automation window to capture a signed request | Same as COOKIE; be patient — may take several seconds |
| `UI` | Full DOM interaction | Same as COOKIE; slowest; results depend on the site's current layout |

If the user doesn't have a login and the adapter's strategy is not `PUBLIC` / `LOCAL`, tell them they need to log into the site in Chrome before retrying.

---

## Step 5: Execute the Command

### General pattern

```bash
opencli <site> <command> [positional-args] [flags] -f json
```

### Universal flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-f json` | Structured JSON — always prefer this for agent processing |
| `-f yaml` / `-f csv` / `-f md` / `-f table` / `-f plain` | Other formats |
| `-v` | Verbose logging (also sets `OPENCLI_VERBOSE=1`) |
| `--live` | Keep the automation window open after the command (browser-backed adapters only) |
| `--focus` | Open the automation window in the foreground (browser-backed adapters only) |

Command-specific flags (`--limit`, `--filter`, `--type`, etc.) are **not** universal — always check `opencli <site> <command> --help`.

### Examples

```bash
# Yahoo Finance quote (PUBLIC)
opencli yahoo-finance quote AAPL -f json

# Reddit hot posts in a subreddit (COOKIE or PUBLIC depending on subreddit)
opencli reddit subreddit wallstreetbets --limit 20 -f json
opencli reddit search "SPY options" --limit 15 -f json

# HackerNews top (PUBLIC)
opencli hackernews top --limit 20 -f json

# Eastmoney hot rank (PUBLIC)
opencli eastmoney hot-rank -f json

# Xueqiu hot stocks (PUBLIC or COOKIE)
opencli xueqiu hot-stock -f json
opencli xueqiu stock SH600519 -f json

# Bloomberg markets headlines (COOKIE)
opencli bloomberg markets -f json

# arXiv paper search (PUBLIC)
opencli arxiv search "volatility surface" --limit 10 -f json

# Substack feed
opencli substack feed --limit 20 -f json

# Web page → readable markdown (PUBLIC)
opencli web read "https://example.com/article" -f json
```

### Key rules

1. **Always use `opencli <site> <command> --help`** before constructing a command you haven't run this session — don't assume flag names.
2. **Use `-f json`** for programmatic processing.
3. **Start with a small `--limit`** (10–20) to validate the shape before pulling more.
4. **Check `strategy` before running a browser-backed adapter** — if the user isn't logged in, a `COOKIE` / `UI` adapter will fail.
5. **NEVER execute write operations.** Common write command names to avoid across adapters: `post`, `reply`, `comment`, `like`, `unlike`, `upvote`, `save`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `follow`, `unfollow`, `block`, `unblock`, `delete`, `bookmark`, `unbookmark`, `send`, `create-draft`, `reply-dm`, `accept`. If you're unsure whether a command is read or write, check the `description` in `opencli list -f json`; if it suggests a mutation, skip it.

---

## Step 6: Handle Failures

If a command returns empty or errors out, the site may have changed its selectors / API. opencli has a built-in self-repair loop:

```bash
# Re-run with diagnostic context
OPENCLI_DIAGNOSTIC=1 opencli <site> <command> <args>
```

This emits a structured `RepairContext` that identifies the failing adapter's source path. Possible responses:

1. If the user has the `opencli-autofix` skill installed, tell them to run that skill.
2. If not, suggest they file an issue at https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues with the `RepairContext` output.
3. Don't silently fall back to hand-rolled scraping — that hides the bug from the upstream registry.

Rate limits on the target site can also cause empty results; wait and retry.

---

## Step 7: Present the Results

1. **Summarize the data** for the user's actual question, don't just dump the raw JSON.
2. **Include source attribution** — site name + URL for each item where available.
3. **For market data**, surface price / % change / volume / market cap and flag anomalies.
4. **For news/posts**, highlight headlines, timestamps, and key quotes.
5. **For research (arXiv, Scholar)**, include title, authors, abstract, and link.
6. **Treat browser sessions as private** — never echo CDP endpoints, cookies, or auth tokens.
