# finance-sentiment

Structured stock sentiment research using the Adanos Finance API.

## What it does

Fetches normalized stock sentiment signals across:

- **Reddit** - buzz, bullish percentage, mentions, trend
- **X.com** - buzz, bullish percentage, mentions, trend
- **News** - buzz, bullish percentage, mentions, trend
- **Polymarket** - buzz, bullish percentage, trades, trend

This skill is useful when a user wants fast answers such as:

- "How much are Reddit users talking about TSLA right now?"
- "How hot is NVDA on X.com this week?"
- "How many Polymarket bets are active on Microsoft right now?"
- "Are Reddit and X aligned on META?"
- "Compare social sentiment on AMD vs NVDA"

**This skill is read-only.** It only fetches sentiment data for research.
